 * - `'path'` ... Determine the locale name from the path of resource. In this case, the locale must be had structured with your rule on the path.
 *                It can be captured with the regular expression named capture. The resource file should only contain messages for that locale.
 * - `'key'`  ... Determine the locale name from the root key name of the file contents. The value of that key should only contain messages for that locale.
 *                Used when the resource file is in the format given to the `messages` option of the `VueI18n` constructor option.

   * You need to use the locale capture as a named capture `?<locale>`, so itâ€™s be able to capture from the path of the locale resources.
